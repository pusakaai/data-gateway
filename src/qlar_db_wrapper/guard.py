"""The on-premise safety net: what this wrapper will and will not run.

**This module assumes Qlar is hostile.** Qlar already validates the SQL it generates, but
the whole point of running a wrapper inside the customer's network is that the customer
should not have to take Qlar's word for it. If Qlar's cloud were compromised tomorrow, the
blast radius should still be "read the tables the customer approved", not "run arbitrary
SQL as the database user".

Three independent layers, in increasing order of strength:

1. **Parse** the statement with `sqlglot` and require exactly one `SELECT`/`WITH`. A parser
   sees through comments, string literals and whitespace tricks that defeat pattern
   matching. Anything that fails to parse is refused rather than guessed at.
2. **Refuse known escape hatches** per dialect — the functions and clauses that turn a
   read into a file read, a shell command or a network call.
3. **Optional table allowlist** from the customer's own config file.

A fourth layer lives outside this module and is the strongest of all: `executor.py` runs
every statement in a `READ ONLY` transaction, and the documentation tells operators to
point the wrapper at a read-only database account. Those are enforced by the database
itself, not by us.
