"""Qlar DB Wrapper — on-premise SQL access wrapper.

The wrapper runs inside the customer's network, pulls SQL jobs from Qlar over an
outbound HTTPS connection, executes them read-only against a local database, and posts
the results back. No inbound port is opened, and the database credentials never leave
the customer's premises.

# Single source of truth for the release version: pyproject.toml reads it from here
# (`[tool.setuptools.dynamic] version = { attr = "qlar_db_wrapper.__version__" }`), so a
# release only ever has to change this line plus CHANGELOG.md.
__version__ = "0.1.3"

# The wire contract version, deliberately separate from the release version. Qlar sends it
# back in every job and rejects a wrapper that speaks a version it does not support, so a
# bug-fix release must NOT bump this — only an incompatible protocol change does.
